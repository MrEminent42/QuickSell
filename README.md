# QuickSell
Slightly improved version of the original QuickSell, hopefully with less bugs.

Added/fixed featues:
* Fixed PrisonGems boosters
* Fixed enable-hierarchy config option
* Added UUID support for Boosters (& converter)
* Added percentage-based boosters (WIP)

## Who?
I'm PixelSquared (a.k.a. MrEminent42), however an overwhelming majority of this plugin was coded by TheBusyBiscuit. You can see his original project on [BukkitDev](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/quicksell) and [GitHub](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/QuickSell).

## Why?
Some bugs needed fixing, so I am fixing them. Seems simple enough.
